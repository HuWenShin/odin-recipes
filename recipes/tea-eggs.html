        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Tea eggs are one of my favorite dishes and traditional lucky food to make for the Lunar New Year. These hard-boiled eggs are subtly flavored with anise and have a deep brown hue from black tea and soy. The marbled patterns from the cracked shells make these quite attractive. I eat them chilled and sliced in quarters as a side dish, appetizer, or snack. Recipe courtesy of Mom.</p>
